Notes
=====

- All information here was public when I scraped it from Miiverse, so I would like to keep it public here, too.
- My goal here is to provide an accurate reproduction of how the parts of Miiverse that were reachable from my profile as of its closure looked like at the time that I scraped them. I am currently failing to achieve that goal, but I can dream...
